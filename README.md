# Schedulize 🗓️

Schedulize is a smart, collaborative scheduling app designed to help groups find the best time to meet, based on everyone's availability and preferences.

## 🌟 Overview

Whether you're coordinating with friends, managing a team, or planning events across time zones, Schedulize simplifies the process by:

- Collecting availability from multiple users
- Generating optimized shared schedules
- Resolving conflicts automatically
- Displaying the result on a shared calendar

This project is being rebuilt from the ground up using modern tools and best practices — including React (with TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, and a Node.js + Express + MongoDB backend.

## 🚧 Status

The project is in early development. Core planning includes:

- ✅ Setting up project structure
- 🛠️ Migrating from legacy code to modern stack
- 🎨 Designing UI components
- 📅 Integrating calendar and scheduling logic

Stay tuned!
